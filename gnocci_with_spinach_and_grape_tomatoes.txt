Servings: 2

Ingredients:
4 oz Heirloom Grape Tomatoes
1 teaspoon Garlic Powder
4 tablespoon Cream Cheese
5 oz Baby Spinach
1 teaspoon Chili Flakes
1/4 cup Panko Breadcrumbs
8.8 oz Gnocchi
veggie stock concentrate
1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese
2 tablespoons Butter
Salt
Pepper

Instructions:
1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. • Halve tomatoes.
2. Melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add panko and cook, stirring, until golden and toasted, 2-3 minutes. Stir in half the garlic powder (you’ll use the rest later) and cook until just fragrant, 30 seconds. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate and season with salt and pepper. Wipe out pan.
3. Once water is boiling, add gnocchi to pot. Cook until tender, 3-4 minutes. • Drain and set aside.
4. While gnocchi cooks, melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for panko over medium-high heat. Add remaining garlic powder and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in 1⁄3 cup water (½ cup for 4), stock concentrate, and cream cheese. Bring to a simmer, stirring, until combined and creamy, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Stir tomatoes and spinach into pan with sauce. Cook, stirring, until spinach is wilted and tomatoes are softened, 3-4 minutes.
6.Stir drained gnocchi into pan with sauce until thoroughly coated. If needed, add a splash or two of water. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Divide gnocchi between bowls and top with Parmesan. Sprinkle with as many garlic butter breadcrumbs as you like. Add a pinch of chili flakes to taste and serve.
