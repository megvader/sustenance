Servings: 2

Ingredients:
13.4 oz chickpeas
1 poblano pepper
1 lime
2 tablespoons southwest spice blend
veggie stock concentrate
4 tablespoons sour cream
1 shallot
1 roma tomato
5 teaspoons white wine finegar
1.5 oz tomato paste
6 flour tortillas
1/2 cup monterey jack cheese
sugar
olive oil
salt
pepper


Instructions:
1.Wash and dry all produce. Halve, peel, and very thinly slice shallot. Drain and rinse chickpeas. Core, deseed, and finely chop poblano. Quarter lime. Dice tomato.
2. In a medium bowl, combine vinegar, half the shallot, 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings), a pinch of salt, and 1 TBSP water until sugar and salt are mostly dissolved. Set aside to pickle, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve.
3. Pat chickpeas dry with paper towels; season with half the Southwest Spice (you’ll use the rest in the next step), salt, and pepper. Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chickpeas and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and crisped, 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a second medium bowl.
4. Heat another large drizzle of olive oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add poblano and remaining shallot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 3-4 minutes. Return chickpeas to pan and stir in tomato paste, stock concentrate, remaining Southwest Spice, and ¼ cup water (½ cup for 4 servings). Cook, stirring, until chickpeas are coated in a thick sauce, 2-3 minutes more.
5. While filling cooks, wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds. In a small bowl, combine sour cream and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
6. Divide tortillas between plates. Fill with chickpea filling, tomato, Monterey Jack, crema, and as much pickled shallot (draining first) as you like. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
