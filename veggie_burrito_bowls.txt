Servings: 2

Ingredients:
1 Yellow Onion
13.4 oz black beans
13.4 oz corn
1/2 cup jasmine rice
veggie stock concentrate (however much you need to make it be the right concentration for the water for the rice)
1 roma tomato
1/4 oz cilantro (some??)
1/4 cup monterey jack cheese
3 oz corn chips
1 tablespoon southwest spice blend
1 lime
4 tablespoons sour cream
1 tea spoon hot sauce (cholula)
olive oil
pepper
salt
butter


Instructions:
1. Wash and dry all produce.  Halve, peel , and dice onion.  Drain and rinse beans and corn, keeping them seperate. 
2. Melt 2 TBSP butter in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until softened, 4-5 minutes. Stir in rice, beans, stock concentrate, and half the Southwest Spice (you’ll use the rest later). Add ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings) and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. Meanwhile, dry corn thoroughly with paper towels, removing as much moisture as possible. Heat a large, preferably nonstick, pan over high heat. Add corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly charred, 4-6 minutes. (TIP: If corn begins to pop, cover pan.) Season with salt and pepper.
4. While corn cooks, dice tomato. Zest and quarter lime. Finely chop cilantro. In a medium bowl, combine corn, tomato, half the cilantro, remaining Southwest Spice, a pinch of lime zest, a large drizzle of olive oil, and a squeeze of lime juice to taste. Season with plenty of salt and pepper.
5. In a small bowl, combine sour cream and as much remaining lime zest and juice as you like. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Fluff rice mixture with a fork; season with salt and pepper. Divide between bowls and top with salsa, Monterey Jack, and remaining cilantro. Drizzle with crema and as much hot sauce as you like. Serve with tortilla chips for dipping and any remaining lime wedges on the side.
