Servings: 2

Ingredients:
13.4 oz chickpeas
3 oz carrot (1? 2?? idk)
1 oz Golden Raisins
1/2 cup Basmati Rice
4 oz shredded Red Cabbage
4 oz kale
1 lemon
1 table spoon curry powder
veggie stock concentrate
6 tablespoons sour cream
olive oil
sugar
butter
salt
pepper

Instructions:
1. • Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. • Drain and rinse chickpeas; thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Trim, peel, and quarter carrot lengthwise; cut crosswise into ¼-inch-thick pieces. Zest and quarter lemon. Remove and discard any large ribs from kale; finely chop leaves. Place raisins in a small bowl with enough hot water to just cover.
2.  Toss chickpeas on a baking sheet with half the curry powder (you’ll use more in the next step), a large drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until crispy, 18-20 minutes. TIP: It’s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit as they roast.
3.  While chickpeas roast, heat a small pot over high heat. Add 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings), carrot, and ¼ tsp curry powder (½ tsp for 4). (You’ll use the rest of the curry powder in the next step.) Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. • Add rice, 1 cup water (1¾ cups for 4), stock concentrate, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil; cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat.
4. Meanwhile, add 1 tsp sugar and juice from 3 lemon wedges (2 tsp sugar and 6 wedges for 4 servings) to a medium microwave-safe bowl; stir to dissolve. Add cabbage and 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4); season with salt and pepper. Microwave for 1 minute. Set aside, tossing occasionally. • In a second small bowl, combine sour cream, lemon zest, remaining curry powder, and juice from remaining lemon. Season with salt and pepper. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
5. Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add kale and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5-7 minutes. • Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) until melted. Remove from heat.
6.  Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and season with salt and pepper. • Divide between bowls. Drain raisins. Top rice with kale, pickled cabbage, and chickpeas. Sprinkle with raisins, roughly chopping first if desired. Drizzle with dressing and serve.
