Servings: 2

Ingredients:
1 Lemon
2 Scallions
1 Roma Tomato
1 clove Garlic
6 oz Penne Pasta
10 oz Bay Scallops
1.5 oz Tomato Paste
Seafood Stock Concentrate
2 tablespoons Cream Cheese
1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese
1 Chili Pepper
1 teaspoon Vegetable Oil
2 tablespoon Butter
Salt
Pepper

Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and finely chop garlic. Dice tomato. Mince chili. Zest and quarter lemon. Pat scallops dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Once water is boiling, add penne to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain.
3. While pasta cooks, heat 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and a drizzle of oil in a large pan over high heat. Once pan is very hot, add scallops; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Remove pan from heat to cool for 1 minute, then return to medium heat.
4. Add 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings), scallion whites, and garlic to pan used for scallops; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add tomato and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until just softened, 2-3 minutes. TIP: If you like things spicy, stir in half the chili. Stir in tomato paste, cream cheese, stock concentrate, and ¼ cup plain water (1⁄3 cup for 4) until combined. Add half the Parmesan (save the rest for serving) and stir until melted. Remove pan from heat. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Once pasta is drained, return pan with sauce to medium heat; add drained penne, scallops (discard any excess liquid on plate), lemon zest, and a squeeze of lemon juice. • Toss, adding splashes of reserved pasta cooking water as needed, until everything is coated in a creamy sauce, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Divide pasta between bowls and top with scallion greens, remaining Parmesan, and chili to taste. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
