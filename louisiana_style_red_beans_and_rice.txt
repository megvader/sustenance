Servings: 2

Ingredients
1 green bell pepper
1 clove garlic (I recommend doubling+)
4 oz kale
1.5 oz tomato paste
1 teaspoon celery salt
veggie stock concentrate
1 teaspoon hot sauce
2 scallions
13.4 oz kidney beans
1/2 cup jasmine rice
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 tablespoon blackening spice
4 tablespoons sour cream
vegetable oil
butter
salt
pepper

Instructions:
1. Wash and dry all produce. • Halve, core, and finely dice bell pepper. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince garlic. Drain and rinse beans. Remove and discard any large stems from kale.
2. In a small pot, combine rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
3. While rice cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and cook until lightly browned and slightly softened, 4-5 minutes. • Stir in scallion whites and half the garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. • Stir in tomato paste, paprika, celery salt, and Blackening Spice. Cook until thoroughly coated, 30 seconds more.
4. Add beans to pot with aromatics; cook, stirring, until combined. Add 2 stock concentrates (4 for 4 servings) and ½ cup water (¾ cup for 4). Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium low. • Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 8-10 minutes. Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4). Taste and season with salt and pepper. TIP: If stewed beans are too thick, add another splash of water.
5. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. • Stir in kale, ¼ cup water (1⁄3 cup for 4 servings), and remaining stock concentrates. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated and kale is wilted and tender, 5-7 minutes. • Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Fluff rice with a fork; season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice, stewed beans, and kale between bowls. Dollop beans with sour cream. Drizzle with hot sauce to taste. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve.
