Servings: 2

Ingredients:
13.4 oz chickpeas
1 bell pepper
1 tablespoon harissa powder
1/2 cup bulgur wheat
1 persian cucumber
1 roma tomato
2 scallions
1/4 oz dill
1 lemon
4 tablespoons sour cream
1/2 cup feta
olive oil
salt
pepper

Instructions:
1.  Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. • Core, deseed, and dice bell pepper into ½-inch pieces. Drain and rinse chickpeas; pat very dry with paper towels.
2. Toss bell pepper and chickpeas on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp harissa powder (2 tsp for 4 servings), and salt. (You’ll use more harissa powder in the next step.) (For 4, use 2 baking sheets; roast on top and middle racks.) • Roast on top rack until bell pepper is softened and chickpeas are lightly browned, 18-20 minutes. TIP: It’s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit while roasting.
3. While bell pepper and chickpeas roast, in a small pot, combine bulgur, 1 cup water, ½ tsp harissa powder (be sure to measure), and salt (we used ½ tsp). (For 4 servings, combine bulgur with 2 cups water, 1 tsp harissa powder, and 1 tsp salt.) Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until water has absorbed and bulgur is tender, 12-15 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to use in step 5.
4.  Meanwhile, zest and halve lemon. Trim and finely dice cucumber and tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Pick and mince fronds from dill. • In a small bowl, whisk together sour cream, 2 TBSP feta (4 TBSP for 4 servings), and 1 TBSP olive oil. (You’ll use the remaining feta in the next step.) Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Squeeze juice from 1 lemon half (whole lemon for 4 servings) into a large bowl. Whisk in 2 TBSP olive oil (4 TBSP for 4), lemon zest, and salt (we used ¼ tsp). (For 4, use ½ tsp salt.) • If necessary, drain any excess water from bulgur, then stir into bowl along with cucumber, tomato, scallion whites, remaining feta, and minced dill to taste (start with half and add more from there if desired). Taste and season with salt and pepper.
6. Divide tabbouleh between bowls. Top with roasted bell pepper and chickpeas. Drizzle with feta dressing and sprinkle with scallion greens. Cut remaining lemon into wedges and serve on the side.
