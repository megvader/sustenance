Servings: 2

Ingredients:
1 Roma Tomato
1 Long Green Pepper
6 Flour Tortillas
1 Red Onion
13.4 oz Black Beans
1.5 oz Tomato Paste
1/4 oz Cilantro
4 tablespoons Sour Ceam
Tex-Mex Paste
1 Lime
1 tablespoon Southwest Spice Blend
1/2 cup Mexican Cheese Blend
Vegetable Oil
Salt
Butter
Pepper

Instructions:
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 475 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice tomato. Roughly chop cilantro. Halve, peel, and finely dice onion. Quarter lime. Core, deseed, and dice green pepper. Drain beans over a small bowl, reserving liquid.
2. In a second small bowl, combine tomato, cilantro, 2 TBSP onion, and a squeeze of lime juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper. In a third small bowl, combine sour cream with a squeeze of lime juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper; cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add remaining onion; cook until just softened, 2-3 minutes. Add Southwest Spice, half the beans, and 2 TBSP reserved bean liquid (you’ll use more of each in the next step). Cook, stirring, until fragrant and warmed through, 2-3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.
4. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add remaining beans; cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add 3 TBSP remaining bean liquid (you may have some left over). Simmer until warmed through, 1-2 minutes. Lower heat, then stir in 1 TBSP butter and salt (we used ½ tsp kosher salt). Turn off heat; mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. Season with pepper.
5. Spread tortillas with mashed beans. Place a small amount of filling on one half of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, and place enchiladas seam sides down in an 8-by-11-inch baking dish or large ovenproof pan. In a bowl or liquid measuring cup, combine tomato paste, Tex-Mex paste, and ½ cup water. 
6. Pour sauce over enchiladas to thoroughly coat. Top with Mexican cheese. • Bake on top rack until sauce is bubbly and cheese melts, 5-7 minutes. Top enchiladas with lime crema and pico de gallo. Serve directly from baking dish with remaining lime wedges on the side.
