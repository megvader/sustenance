Servings: 16 rolls 

Ingredients:
1 package active dry yeast (Fleshman's is good)
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup milk, scalded
1/4 cup shortening
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups flour
1 egg

Instructions:
1. Soften yeast in warm water (110 degrees) while you mix up the next 3 ingredients
2. Combine milk, sugar, shortening, and salt.  Cool to lukewarm. *
3. add 1 1/2 cups flour, beat well.  Then beat in yeast mixture and egg.  Gradually add remaining flower to form soft dough, beating well.  ** Grease a large bowl with shortening or PAM.  Place dough in greased bowl, turning once to grease the surface.  Cover and let rise until it has doubled, 1 1/2-2 hours.  I usually set the bowl of dough on ta cookie rack on op of a bowl of hot water to speed up the rising process.
4. When the dough has doubled, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape as desired.  Cover and let shaped rolls rise until doubled.  Bake on a greased baking sheet at 400deg for 12-15 minutes.  

*When I add the 1 1/2 cups of flour it cools the milk mixture more quickly
** I usually knead the last cup of flour into the dough on my countertop.  As I typed the recipe tonight I see my Mom [Grandma Bernice] didn't even mention kneading it.  She used her kitchen aid mixer to make the rolls so maybe she didn't think kneading was necessary.
